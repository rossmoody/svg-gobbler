# ðŸ‘‹ SVG Gobbler

Download this extension on the [Chrome Web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/svg-gobbler/mpbmflcodadhgafbbakjeahpandgcbch?hl=en-US&authuser=0) or in the [Add-On Marketplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/svg-gobbler/) for Firefox.

SVG Gobbler is a simple browser extension that finds SVG content in your current window and lets you download, copy to clipboard, or export as a PNG.

## Build locally

Currently, if you would like to modify this extension you will need to install it manually. Before making edits you will need to build it locally and side load SVG Gobbler as a developer extension to test any changes.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the repo to your local machine and navigate into the root directory.

```bash
cd svg-gobbler
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

SVG Gobbler uses `yarn` to build the necessary dependencies.

```bash
yarn
```

#### 3. Bundle the extension

Run `yarn start` to tell Webpack to build files into the `extension/dist` folder. This also tells webpack to watch for edits.

```bash
yarn start
```

#### 4. Side load extension

#### Chrome

1. In the address bar, navigate to `chrome://extensions`
1. In the top right of the screen, flip the toggle to enable `Developer Mode`
1. Click the button to `Load unpacked` and select the `extension` folder inside the SVG Gobbler repo

Once this is complete you can start hacking. Editing content in the `src` directory will automatically build and update the extension folder which will feed the extension in the browser the latest code.

#### Firefox

1. After running the `yarn start` command to build and watch changes...
1. Run `yarn firefox:run` to build the extension in a Firefox testing environment

### Development notes

In **Chrome or Brave** if you are editing anything within the `src/find` directory you will need to manually press the `Update` button in the extensions page to refresh your latest code changes.

Code changed within the `src/build` directory will automatically update on page refresh but code that is injected into the client's tab (code within `src/find`) needs manually refreshed from within the extensions page.

In **Firefox** everything works and auto refreshes. It's super pleasant and I do all my extension testing in Firefox.

## ðŸŽ‰ How to use the extension
