## Features

SVG Gobbler is a browser extension that finds the SVG content in your current tab and lets you
optimize, download, copy, edit, or export.

- Handle CORs restricted SVGs from a page
- Find individual sprite SVG instances

### Export SVGs

- Export as SVG, PNG, WEBP, JPEG and various other formats
- Transform SVGs into minified Data URIs
- Transform SVGs into React components with SVGR
- Optimize and minify SVGs with SVGO

### Organize SVGs

- Move, copy, duplicate, and optimize icons before sharing
- Save and store a set of uploaded SVGs for optimization

## Local development

Before making edits you will need to build the extension locally and side load it as a developer
extension to test any changes.

> The sourcing and processing logic is abstracted into a separate package called
> `svg-gobbler-scripts` [here](https://github.com/rossmoody/svg-gobbler-scripts).

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the repo to your local machine and navigate into the root directory.

```shell
cd svg-gobbler
```

### 2. Install dependencies

SVG Gobbler uses yarn to build the necessary dependencies.

```shell
yarn
```

### 3. Start and watch a build

For development with hot reloading use Vite:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will build to the `dist` folder. To load the extension, open the Extensions Dashboard, enable
"Developer mode", click "Load unpacked", and choose the `dist` folder.

When you make changes in src the background script and any content script will reload automatically.

### 4. Start the server

For a majority of the functionality you won't need a server. If you want to make some local fetch
calls related to Node processes in a separate terminal session cd into the `server` directory.

```bash
cd server
```

Install the necessary dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

From this directory, compile the server function to the `dist` folder.

```bash
yarn build
```

In a separate terminal session serve the function on a local server.

```bash
yarn serve
```

This will startup the server and restart it any time a change is recompiled.

This extension is open source and doesn't collect any information from users. It's free, and made
available because I enjoy making useful things for the web. Please consider contributing with an
idea, bug fix, or feature request.
